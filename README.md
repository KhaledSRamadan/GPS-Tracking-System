# GPS-Tracking-System
In this repo we document our progress in the GPS Tracking System project required for the Microprocessor-based Systems course.
NOTE: Our main source code file is "Coordinates processing.c", and "init.c" is an older version.

Main components used:
- tm4c123gh6pm (TivaC) microcontroller 
- Ublox NEO-6m GPS Module
